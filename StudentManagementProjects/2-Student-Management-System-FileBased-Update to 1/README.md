## 🔧 Future Improvements

This project is a work in progress and will be improved in future versions.

Planned improvements include:

- Better file format (e.g., CSV or binary files)  
- Adding delete confirmation and undo  
- Separating logic into multiple files/classes  
- Improving code readability and structure  
- Adding search filters (e.g., by level or major)  
- Using object-oriented programming (OOP)  

We are actively working to enhance this project soon.
